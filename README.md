A social media application inspired from instagram.

## Features

- User can add posts on their account 🌃
- User can follow other user to stay updated with their posts 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
- User can like ❤️ and comment 🗣on other user posts
- If a user commented and liked someones post then the post owner will recive the notification regarding the updates in activity feed 🔔
- Each user will have a personalised timeline contains post of the user and all the other user whom he/she follows 📱
- And there is a search section to find other user to increase the network 🔎

## Technology stack

- The app is created with flutter and dart as the programming language (Advantage - The same source code can be used to create application on iOS and web) 😁
- For database part, I used firestore as it's free and easy to use 😉
